								<h2 class="major">Interests in IT</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/interests.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Q1) What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</p>
								<p>My interests in IT are very broad, essentially anything and everything in the IT world interests me, especially software development and cyber security where I hope to pursue a career in either field. For me, my interests in IT started at a very young age when my parents purchased their first computer, instantly I became fascinated in they way computers worked and their capabilities. While still in my earlier years, computers interested me, however I didn’t pursue obtaining knowledge until I learnt about the IT world and potential jobs available from a family friend and YouTube videos. My IT experience ranges from building computers and  setting up local-area-networks all the way to  fixing hardware and software issues.</p>
								<p>Q2) Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</P>
								<p>After attending the RMIT open day I decided that RMIT would be the best fit for me because the IT courses provided seemed the most flexible between theory work and practical experience. Also, RMIT posed more benefits such as, satisfying my social needs as the majority of my friends also chose RMIT. Additionally, RMIT Melbourne campuses is simple to travel to as it only requires one train directly to Melbourne central. </P>
								<p>Q3) What do you expect to learn during your studies? </P>
								<p>I expect to learn a variety of skills in the IT field that will assist me in successfully obtaining a job, as well as  also allowing me to exceed to greater limits in the position I find myself in, being either promotion or starting my own business. Hopefully after finishing my bachelor degree I will have extensive knowledge in multiple fields allowing me to present myself as a well-rounded IT employee. </P>

									<p>The Big Five personailty test:</p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/big5.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>What do the results of these tests mean for you? </p>
									<p>From the first test results it is clear to me that I tend to sit in the middle of things as it shows I am observant and only 51% Extraverted, meaning the ill usually observe what is going on and only present my opinion when I think it is necessary. From the second results it shows I learn best from actually completing a task and figuring out on my own how to do it rather then listening to instruction or seeing it done. Lastly, with the third results it signifies that I am able to stay on track and get tasks done to the best of my ability whilst also being able to understand other’s needs. </p>
									<p>How do you think these results may influence your behavior in a team? </p>
									<p>The results present that my behavior in a group would be observant and contribute on points where I believe my advice would be beneficial, also when I am certain on something, I will ensure it is done correctly. Additionally, I will be motivated to complete all tasks on time and correctly so that success is achieved. Lastly, I would be understanding and agree with most decisions made if it would result in the best outcome. </p>
									<p>How should you take this into account when forming a team? </p>
									<p>While taking my behavior into account It would be best to form a team with people who are more extraverted and willing to be the center of attention when making decisions and getting people organized. Also, it would be beneficial to form a team with people who are open to advice and willing to listen. </p>

								<article id="Project">
									<h2 class="major">Project Idea</h2>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Overview:  </p>
									<p>The project I would like to create would be a smart phone application that has the primary function of being an interactive shopping list. Essentially, I am looking a developing an app that will allow groups of people such as friends living together or a family  to sign up  as a connected private group, where the users of that group can login on their own devices and add items to the shopping list, so at the end of the week there will be an accumulated list of items, from each person if they choose to.</p>
									<p>Motivation:</p>
									<p>The motivation for developing  this project comes from my own personal experiences where I have been constantly met with the frustration of opening the cupboard for food to only find bread or cereal. Which lead me to the idea of setting up an application where everyone in the household could add items to a list when they think of it, rather then forgetting and being met with the same frustration. Also, I see this project to have potential of being successful as it poses a solution to current outdated method of think of items and writing them on a piece of paper before you go to the shops.</p>
									<p>Description: </p>
									<p>Feature 1 – Create Account</p>
									<p>This feature allows users to create their own personal account protected by a password. In order for them to signup the user will need to provide an email address, username and lastly a password followed by 3 security questions. Upon signing up, users will be given access to the features of the app allowing them to begin their experience. </p>
									<p>Feature 2 – Group Connection</p>
									<p>This feature being the heart and sole of the app, will allow users to setup an account and create a private group that is protected by a 4-digit pin, once the group has been created the user will then be able to invite fellow family members or roommates who have also signed up for the app. In the group their will be a shared document (The shopping list)  where each user will have the ability to add items or remove items. When setting up the group, users will be able to choose an icon to identify themselves which will appear next to the items they add to the list, so users know who the  groceries are for  , avoiding confusion.</p>
									<p>Feature 3 – Shopping list</p>
									<p>The shopping list is an interactive document which is accessible to all allocated members of the created group (from group connections). The document will have the functionality and capability of having items added and subtracted from the list. Users will also have the ability to add a quantity and if desired add the price of the items. Also, when users are entering an item to the list, they will be given an option of uploading an accompanying image if they desire to. Additionally, in the document settings users will be given an option to choose if the list will refresh once a week (clearing it) or keep the list until everything has been checked of. Also users will be given an option to add a permanent list which will appear at the top of the document every time the list is cleared. Users can use this function to ensure items that will always be needed won’t be forgotten, for example milk, toilet paper etc. Users will also be able to set up restrictions on the document, for example limiting items to save money, or restricting children from adding unhealthy food.</p>
									<p>Feature 4 -  Store catalogues (updated weekly)</p>
									<p>In the menu of the app, users will be able to access a range of catalogues from the big brand shopping centers such as Coles, Woolies and ALDI’S. If users see an item they need or want, they will be able to add the item to their shopping list by easily clicking on the item and choosing a quantity. Once a user has added an item from a store catalogue their own personal catalogue will be created titled “Personal catalogue”, in this catalogue every item they have chosen previously will be stored so each user will have their own personalized catalogue to choose the items they always want or need each week. Additionally, there will also be a group catalogue which is identical to “Personal catalogue” however it includes everyone’s catalogue into one big one, allowing an ease of selection.</p>
									<p>Tools and Technologies:</p>
									<p>Software –</p>
									<p>The software that would be needed to develop this project is XCode, which is an ‘integrated development environment for macOS’ which contains a suite of software development tools. Also, the latest version of MacOS will be required.</p>
									<p>Hardware – </p>
									<p>A mac computer will be needed to run XCode allowing the development of the app. Also, a phone will be needed to test the application and fix any errors or glitches within the application.</p>
									<p>Server – </p>
									<p>A server will be needed in order to host the application so that user’s data can be stored and transmitted to multiple devices.</p>
									<p>Skills required:</p>
									<p>Software – </p>
									<p>For the software side of this project the skills that will be necessary include a competent level and understanding of how to use the programming language Swift. Also, I would need to have the ability to use XCode whilst also have the skills to trouble shoot and handle errors.</p>
									<p>Feasibility -</p>
									<p>To find the skills necessary to complete this project will be relatively easily as there are numerous tutorials online including YouTube guides on how to learn the programming language Swift. Additionally, there are user guides on how to properly use the development environment ‘XCode’. Also, the knowledge of trouble shooting, and error handling will be learnt throughout my course at RMIT.</p>
									<p>Outcome:</p>
									<p>If the project is successful, the likely outcome would be that the app would be approved onto the app s market place, dragging in thousands of users around the globe to use the interactive shopping list application. Once people start using the application the problem of constantly forgetting groceries will slowly start to fade as the app integrates into their lives making their shopping experiences much simpler and easier for everyone. The impact of this development will add to the long list of presenting to the world how when used correctly, technology can benefit humanity and make usually tedious tasks simple and effortless.</p>
